# Token Payment Processor Testplan

&nbsp;

## Background
This testplan is going to cover the token payment processor, it will go over must haves and additional features that we can add on later. 

UI relating to token payment processing can be seen on [Billing Page](https://www.figma.com/file/HlmasFJNHxs2lzGerq3WYH/Satellite-GUI-Public?node-id=11080%3A68109) figma design.

|               |         Minimum Confirmation         |                                                                                         A transaction should not be called paid unless it meets the minimum number of confirmations reached (this should be visible in UI, pending until it meets minimum number of confirmations)                                                                                        |                                            Must have early on (Alpha)                                            |

|               | Two Transactions                     | If there is a pending transaction with less than the number of required confirmations and then there is a reorg and said transaction gets overridden with a longer chain, the old pending transaction should then get removed                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                  |
|               | Stale Pending Transactions           | Pending transactions that have less than the number of required confirmations and have been stale for a set time should be deleted from the Satellite DB and not stored again                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                  |
|               | Pending Transactions                 | Same as above case, except it will be again stored in DB since all pending transactions are wiped from the DB regardless if they are stale or not (in this case its not stale, just pending and waiting for the minimum # of confirmations)                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                  |
|               | Required Block Confirmations         | Transactions should have their required blocks for confirmation high enough so that even if there is a reorg with a pending transaction that contains f.e two chains same length in parallel, there shouldn't be an issue                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                  |

|               | Timestamp Issue                      | It should not be possible for two transactions on a block to share the same timestamp, however If there are two deposits with the same amount to the same address in the same block, then it would mean that they have the same timestamp and the only difference would be the transaction hash because of the different nonce (this is an issue with our current design) | Current Design, design will be changed so timestamp will not be relied on                                        |
|               | Rescan                               | Rescan should always start from the last fully confirmed block f.e in a reorg, so rescan should start at the height of said block                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                  |
|               | Invoice Generation                   | When an invoice is generated and "paid", coupons should be used first, followed by storx balance and then lastly credit card                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | This invoice should be shown to our accounting team and they should be asked if said invoice looks correct       |
